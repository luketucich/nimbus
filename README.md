## Tech Stack

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Webpack

## The Takeaway

Developing Nimbus deepened my understanding of asynchronous programming in JavaScript, particularly using async/await to handle API calls to the VisualCrossing service. This approach streamlined fetching and displaying real-time weather data efficiently.

A key focus was mastering API integration‚Äîconstructing dynamic requests based on user input, parsing JSON responses, and updating the UI seamlessly. This enhanced my ability to work with external data sources within a web application.

I prioritized robust error handling to gracefully manage invalid inputs and unexpected API responses, ensuring a reliable user experience. Additionally, managing asynchronous operations with async/await kept the code clean and readable, simplifying debugging and future feature enhancements.

User interface and experience were also essential. Implementing responsive design made Nimbus Weather accessible and visually appealing across various devices and screen sizes. Smooth transitions, intuitive navigation, and a toggle switch for changing weather units contributed to a user-friendly application.

Overall, developing Nimbus strengthened my skills in asynchronous JavaScript, API integration, error handling, clean coding practices, and responsive UI/UX design.
